# The docker daemon binds to a Unix socket instead of a TCP port.
# Which by default is owned by the user root and other users can only access it using sudo.
# The docker daemon always runs as the root user.
# The SONiC build scripts use the docker command without sudo, so we need to add our use to the docker group
# create a Unix group called docker and add users to it (usually the group is already created when installing docker).
# When the docker daemon starts, it makes the ownership of the Unix socket read/writable by the docker group.
